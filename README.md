# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
Step 1: Create a text file in a specific loaction of interest.
Step 2: On the same location as the text file, create a python program file.
Step 3: In python Program, import sys and open a text file with argument "sys.argv[1]"
Step 4: using read() and split(), split the lines in the file into a sequence of words.
Step 5:using len() count the number of words in the text file.
Step 6: In command prompt, initiate python followed by program name and text file name to get the output.
